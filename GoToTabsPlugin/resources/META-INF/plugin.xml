        DEPRECATED: It took a few years but switching between tabs is now supported out
        of the box (Keymap -> Other -> Tabs). You don't need this plugin anymore. Revolutionary.
        <br><br>

        The plugin adds menu actions allowing you to go to a specific tab. You can of
        course assign keyboard shortcuts the individual actions and for example achieve
        the behavior known from other editors/IDEs where you can switch between tabs
        with <i>alt+&lt;num&gt;</i>.<br><br>

        To prevent any conflicts, the plugin doesn't assign any shortcuts by itself, you
        need to do it manually in the Keymap (section Main menu -> Window -> Editor Tabs
        -> Go To Tabs).
